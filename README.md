# ATM Challenge

As a starter I've taken Cool React Starter created by WellyShen <hivoid19@gmail.com> (https://github.com/wellyshen), because it represents my choice of tech stack for developement on React. So basically this starter gives us universal express based application with React, Redux, SASS assembled by Webpack with Jest as a testing framework.
